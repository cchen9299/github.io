                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Trea Inc is a company founded and owned by my brother-in-law's father and it is where my brother-in-law works at. The company has an up and running website, but due to his father's belief that the company has no need of it, it has seen the best of its days. My brother-in-lawl, on the other hand, believes that the use of modern marketing tools such as a well constructed website could help the business. Over the years, he has tried to improve the website and maintain it, but never carried through to the end. I visited them in the summer of 2017 and figured that I could give him a hand while adding a new project to my portfolio. I had also recently gotten access to an old mac and I am eager to learn new software that is avalible only to macs like Sketch and Framer. This is another project that I used as a platform to broaden my technical skills in digital design.</p>

                        <h3>The Beginnings</h3>
                        <p>Here's a <a href="http://www.treainc.com" target="_blank">link</a> to the current website. The current user interface and content of the website is pretty depressing. Some of the images seemed like random images pulled from stock images and the copies and content repeat themselves in different tabs. Although my brother-in-law has plans to eventually create a functional ecommerce website where you could possibly place orders online, the current website's purpose is nothing more than a very basic platform to tell people a little about the company. With some notes from my brother-in-law and a simple task ahead, I began restructuring  the website. </p>

                    <h3>High Fidelity</h3>
                    <p>I originally had a couple sketches drawn out for low-fidelity, but I was surprised by the ease of use of Sketch and dove into creating high fidelities right away. I picked the home page and the service page to design first because these pages should be able to lay down the style guide for the rest of the pages. Ideally, I would like to go with the order placement page, but I haven't received much information of what kind of content will be in it from my brother-in-law. Like my other projects, I like to develop a couple different iterations/versions to test and see what my client or targeted user prefer. In this case, it is really determining if my brother-in-law would enjoy a very modern, immersive yet minimal design or something more conservative.</p>

                    <h3>Mobile</h3>
                    <p>Although my brother-in-law seems to have a mobile website in mind, it is a great opportunity for me to get familiarize with the powerful community supported features in Sketch. Aside from all the useful plug-ins Sketch provides, there a lot of free materials developed by the community including iOS UI elements (aside from the built in one). Now that I have a mac in hand, my next step towards the mobile designs is to develop a prototype using another powerful software that i am trying to pick up, Framer. So hopefully this page won't be too cluttered by the long mobile design that I'm trying to show once I have that developed.</p>
