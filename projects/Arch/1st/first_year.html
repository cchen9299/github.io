                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>The foundation year at Virginia Tech was not only for the students of architecture, but also landscape architecture, interior design and industrial design. It was a year of exploration in the fundamentals in design where students studied philosophical design questions through different projects given. These projects may seem a joke to people that does not fully understand the purpose, but the questions that are raised in each project are all targeting at the universal qualities in all design subjects. I have to admit I wasn't very good at documenting the process and projects during first year, but I did gather my best projects throughout first year.</p>

                <h3>Lit</h3>
                <p>I was a transfer student into the architecture program at Virginia Tech. Due to the high volume of applicants, the transfer students had to go through an interview and a summer qualifying lab to have a chance to get into the school. Lit was the final project that I made during the summer lab. The prompt was very open ended. We were given several selection of materials and had to create an object of design with the material and skills we acquired in the summer. I have always wanted to create objects of play. Lit was a lamp concept that has rings within rings that will create a play with the mind, eye and light.</p>

                    <h3>Repetition</h3>
                    <p>One of the very first project upon my acceptance into the school was a project created using the idea of repetition. This is the project where I learned that design isn't always about full ownership and steering of the project. Rather, design should be something much more organic. A designer should not overly control, dictate and limit a projects potential, but seek out the potential and push the project towards its own potential. I merely found objects that are in numbers at my desk and started playing around with them and this was the final result. It is unfortunate that I have lost the very first two iterations of the project and did not document them. They were connected with adhesive at the joints and was very fragile. Which led me to the production of the third one where the connection between the pencils were through a fishing line.</p>

                <h3>Preservation Hall Jazz Band</h3>
                <p>The Preservation Hall Jazz Band poster was probably the highlight of my graphical skills in first year. The band was touring and made a visit at our campus. Our professors gave us this speed prompt of making a hypothetical poster for them. The band is from New Orleans and has been playing for a long time with different members. That was the most notable element in my design. The faces of the people wasn't the most important part of this band as they are not the identity of the band. I then infused the poster with a little taste of New Orleans.

                    <h3>Package</h3>
                    <p>One of the very first designers that we looked at was actually not some famous architect or famous designer, but Steve Jobs and the way that he directed Apple to look at how products come together. The way each product packaging comes together was not only a way of elegance but also a very minimal design. Thus, we were given the prompt to use easy materials to create a packaging system that requires no adhesive. The material should be able to enclose an object with its own physical properties. The package that I came up with was rather simple. It is a technique that people use at the bottom of a cardboard box to shape the box without using tape. However, a card board box usually had its ends attached either with some sort of additional material, but I created slats that allowed the friction of the box itself to hold in the shape.</p>

                <h3>Naef</h3>
                <p>Naef is a high end Swiss toy company that has a good relationship with the school. They come to the school every four years to host a competition where the winner has a chance to have their design be included into their catalog. They are probably best known for their dissected cube toy that is able to be turned in to multiple variations. I also have a personal favor towards the concept of a cube and one night I came up with this idea that extrudes the xyz axis that would ultimately form a cube while be able to have variations of other geometric forms.</p>
