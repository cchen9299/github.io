                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This is a freelance UX project with The History Factory. The History Factory is a company that does a lot of corporate exhibition. This particular one that I worked on for them was for a large utility company in the mid-west. The entirety of the project was to plan, design and construct the new lobby exhibition for the utility company showcasing their history, services and their future plans at their corporate headquarters. The exhibition contains physical static kiosks, banners, column art, digital kiosks and a 30 feet by 12 feet touch screen wall. I was teamed with another freelance UX designer, Jeff, to design all the digital contents in the interactive wall and digital kiosk from their functions to their interfaces. My particular focus was on the digital kiosks that's spread around the lobby. There was no budget given to UX research for this project, but thankfully Jeff, my partner in this project, has close to 20 years of practice experience in digital design and has worked for companies like Yahoo and Accenture as a Full stack developer. We are teamed up with Northern Light Production's development team for this project. NLP does a lot of similar projects like THF, but with a Museum context. They have an in-house development team with an already developed framework, Story Crafter, which we are applying our templates to.</p>

                        <h3>The Beginnings</h3>
                        <p>There was a lot of scattered information at first just because of the nature of the project. The lobby is split into five different areas with different "theme". One of the area is where the huge interactive wall will be installed. A total of 7 digital kiosks resides within these 4 areas. Each digital kiosk has its own unique content. There is a lot of content to be covered in total, but each digital kiosk only gets, at most, a few tabs of content. The script for these content is pretty straight forward. So forward that it really is a read and flip action between the user and the kiosk. It is very similar to digital kiosks at a Museum where you touch the screen and read and touch and read. So to break it down to its core, the digital kiosks were websites with two to three tabs of information for the user to read. So with some simple tasks laid in front of me, I quickly sketched out some user flows and some page layouts.</p>

                    <h3>After the Warmup</h3>
                    <p>There are two difficult parts to this seemingly simple project. The first one is its design. I have not designed any kiosks let alone a museum information like kiosk. After some research online, it seems like either not many people do it either or people don't like to showcase with these types of projects. I had a very hard time searching for examples of what other has done. The majority of the low fidelity wireframes turn into more of a focus on the functionality. As part of my design process, I like to present at least two ways of interactions and evaluate them with other designers. I like to test out what others have in mind and what kind of style other people like with visual designs than verbal descriptions. So I usually produce very fast and like to get really dirty. After a few rounds of back and forth, I will then be able to settle down and develop something more refined based on my conversations.</p>

                    <h3>Design Development</h3>
                    <p>The functionality brings me to my second challenge. Due to the nature of the content, it's incredibly simple for someone to just plot all the copy onto different pages with a next arrow for as the functionality. But that really defeats the point of having all this content into digital screens. With the script already provided and approved by the client, there isn't much to the script that we can change at this point. So the main focus was then turned towards the presentation of these content. After a couple rounds of conversations with the client, we found that they completely agree with us that it should break away from a static and stale feeling. They also want to celebrate the people by using a lot of imagery. We decided that, in addition to the photography, we would make the overall experience more dynamics by implementing ideas from Facebook Paper. A card like display system that provides a better sense of dynamics and provide the screen a sense of layering effect. 2.5 animations and videos will also take over static photo pages, tabs will open more like a modal or a light box and so forth. <br><br> Here's a <a  href="https://invis.io/XYE8DFKBA#/261385758_Intro" target="_blank" >link</a> to a two page prototype for the digital pods.</p>

                    <p><br><br><br>The fact that THF does not have an in-house UX team and the head designer is only in charge of the static contents, the structure of the design process was a little loose. Jeff and I spent a lot of the time developing the wall because it is the main attraction of the exhibition. The rest of the time we dirzzle back and forth between producing a presentable high fidelity and brushing up on the functionality.<br><br> Here's a

                    <h3>Templates</h3>
                    <p>The project's overall design was approved by the client at this point. The rest of the tasks to do is to prepare production files to hand off to the development team. Over the span of the project, we've split up the script into forty something pages. Considering that the development team is using their own framework with UI elements already designed and implemented, it only made sense for us to provide them with template that would plug in to their framework instead of develop everything we hand off to them down to the pixel. So I organized the pages into page types for production purposes and then developed simple maps of how to navigate within the pages. </p>

                    <p>Once all the page types/templates has been identified, we did a final push on the functionality of the templates. After the functionality has been locked in, the final UI and aesthetics will then be implemented.

                    <p>I started Tape Measure as a web application because most of the superintendents that I have met are more fluent with desktops than their mobile devices. It is also harder for them to focus on a mobile device for a long period of time due to physical limitations. My next step for Tape Measure is to develop responsive web applications for mobile use and eventually an app. Now if I ever develop enough development skills, maybe I will one day finish the project 100% and publish it?</p>
